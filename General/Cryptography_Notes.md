**_Ciphertext_** <br> The result of encrypting a plaintext, encrypted data

**_Cipher_** <br> A method of encrypting or decrypting data. Modern ciphers are cryptographic, but there are many non cryptographic ciphers like Caesar.

**_Plaintext_** <br> Data before encryption, often text but not always. Could be a photograph or other file

**_Encryption_** <br> Transforming data into ciphertext, using a cipher.

**_Encoding_** <br> NOT a form of encryption, just a form of data representation like base64. Immediately reversible.

**_Key_** <br> Some information that is needed to correctly decrypt the ciphertext and obtain the plaintext.

**_Passphrase_** <br> Separate to the key, a passphrase is similar to a password and used to protect a key.

**_Asymmetric_** encryption <br> Uses different keys to encrypt and decrypt.

**_Symmetric encryption_** <br> Uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt

**_Brute force_** <br> Attacking cryptography by trying every different password or every different key

**_Cryptanalysis_** <br> Attacking cryptography by finding a weakness in the underlying maths
